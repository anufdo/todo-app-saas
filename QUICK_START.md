## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Working
```bash
# Check Stripe CLI is running
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

# Verify webhook secret in .env.local matches CLI output
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx

# Check terminal logs for errors
```

### Checkout Fails
```bash
# Verify all price IDs are correct
echo $STRIPE_PREMIUM_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID

# Test in Stripe Dashboard that prices exist
# Make sure test mode is enabled
```

### Teams Show "Requires Upgrade"
```bash
# Check tenant plan in database or admin panel
# Must be "premium_plus"

# Manually upgrade via admin panel if needed
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Reinstall dependencies  
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build
```

## üìä Database Inspection

### Check Billing Records
```sql
SELECT * FROM "Billing" WHERE "tenantId" = 'your_tenant_id';
```

### Check Subscription Status
```sql
SELECT 
  t.name,
  t.plan,
  t."stripeCustomerId",
  t."stripeSubscriptionId",
  b.status,
  b."currentPeriodEnd"
FROM "Tenant" t
LEFT JOIN "Billing" b ON t.id = b."tenantId"
WHERE t.subdomain = 'demo';
```

### Check Teams
```sql
SELECT 
  te.name as team_name,
  COUNT(tm.id) as member_count,
  COUNT(ta.id) as task_count
FROM "Team" te
LEFT JOIN "TeamMembership" tm ON te.id = tm."teamId"
LEFT JOIN "Task" ta ON te.id = ta."teamId"
WHERE te."tenantId" = 'your_tenant_id'
GROUP BY te.id, te.name;
```
