# Bug Fixes & Admin Panel Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Role Not Working
**Problem:** Admin users were being treated as normal users with no special permissions.

**Solution:**
- Updated `auth.config.ts` to fetch user memberships during authentication
- Added role, tenantId, subdomain, and hasTenant fields to JWT token and session
- Updated TypeScript types in `src/types/index.ts` to include new session fields
- Users now get their highest role (owner > admin > member) assigned to their session

### 2. Always Redirecting to Onboarding
**Problem:** Users who already had a tenant were being redirected to onboarding on every login.

**Solution:**
- Modified signin logic in `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` to check if user has a tenant
- If user has a tenant (hasTenant = true), redirect to their workspace
- If user doesn't have a tenant, redirect to onboarding
- Handles both localhost (with query parameter) and production (with subdomain) environments

### 3. Missing Admin Panel
**Problem:** Sprint plan step 8 required an admin panel, but it didn't exist.

**Solution:**
- Created `/src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Admin panel layout with navigation
- Created `/src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Tenant management interface
- Created `/src/app/actions/admin.ts` - Server actions for admin operations
- Added middleware protection for `/admin` routes (only admin/owner can access)
- Added admin link to app navigation (only visible for admin/owner users)

## New Features

### Admin Panel Features
Located at `/admin`, accessible only to users with `admin` or `owner` role:

1. **View All Tenants**
   - See all tenants in the system
   - View statistics: members, tasks, usage
   - See plan and status for each tenant

2. **Change Tenant Plan**
   - Upgrade/downgrade between Free, Premium, and Premium Plus
   - Changes apply immediately

3. **Change Tenant Status**
   - Set status: Active, Suspended, or Deleted
   - Controls tenant access

4. **Delete Tenant**
   - Permanently delete a tenant (owner only)
   - Includes confirmation dialog

## Files Modified

### Authentication & Session
- `src/lib/auth.config.ts` - Added membership and role fetching
- `src/types/index.ts` - Extended session types
- `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Smart redirect logic
- `src/middleware.ts` - Admin route protection

### Admin Panel (New)
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Admin layout
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Tenant management UI
- `src/app/actions/admin.ts` - Admin server actions

### Navigation
- `src/app/app/layout.tsx` - Added admin link for admin users

### Bug Fixes
- `src/components/UpgradeCta.tsx` - Fixed apostrophe escape
- `src/app/app/tasks/page.tsx` - Removed unused error variables
- `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Removed unused error variables
- `src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Removed unused error variables
- `src/hooks/use-toast.ts` - Fixed unused type warning

## Database Changes

The seed script now properly creates:
- Demo user (demo@example.com / password123) with `owner` role
- Admin user (admin@example.com / admin123!) with `admin` role
- Both users are members of the demo tenant

## Testing

### Test Admin Access
1. Sign in as admin: `admin@example.com` / `admin123!`
2. You should see the üõ°Ô∏è Admin link in the navigation
3. Click it to access the admin panel at `/admin`
4. Try changing a tenant's plan or status

### Test Regular User
1. Sign in as regular user: `demo@example.com` / password123
2. You should NOT see the admin link
3. Trying to access `/admin` directly will redirect to tasks

### Test Onboarding
1. Create a new user via signup
2. After signin, should redirect to onboarding (no tenant yet)
3. Create a workspace
4. On subsequent logins, should redirect directly to your workspace
