# Security Fix: Admin Panel Access Control

## Issue Identified
The demo user (with "owner" role) was able to access the platform admin panel and manage all tenants, including deleting the admin user's tenant. This was a critical security flaw.

## Root Cause
The middleware and admin panel were checking for BOTH "admin" OR "owner" roles, but they should only check for "admin" role since:
- **Platform Admin Panel** = System-wide management (only "admin" role)
- **Tenant Owner** = Manages their own tenant (not platform-wide)

## Changes Made

### 1. Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
**Before:**
```typescript
if (userRole !== "admin" && userRole !== "owner") {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/app/tasks", request.url));
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only users with "admin" role can access platform admin panel
if (userRole !== "admin") {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/app/tasks", request.url));
}
```

### 2. Admin Layout (`src/app/admin/layout.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
const isAdmin = session?.user?.role === "admin" || session?.user?.role === "owner";
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Check if user is admin (platform-level admin only, not tenant owner)
const isAdmin = session?.user?.role === "admin";
```

### 3. App Layout (`src/app/app/layout.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
const isAdmin = session?.user?.role === "admin" || session?.user?.role === "owner";
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Only show admin link for platform admins (not tenant owners)
const isAdmin = session?.user?.role === "admin";
```

### 4. Admin Actions (`src/app/actions/admin.ts`)
Updated all admin action functions to only allow "admin" role:

**getAllTenants():**
```typescript
const membership = await db.membership.findFirst({
  where: {
    userId: session.user.id,
    role: "admin" // Only platform admins
  }
});

if (!membership) {
  return { error: "Not authorized - Platform admin access required" };
}
```

**updateTenantPlan(), updateTenantStatus():**
Same pattern - check for "admin" role only

**deleteTenant():**
```typescript
// Check if user has platform admin role (only platform admins can delete)
const membership = await db.membership.findFirst({
  where: {
    userId: session.user.id,
    role: "admin"
  }
});

if (!membership) {
  return { error: "Not authorized - Only platform admins can delete tenants" };
}
```

## Role Clarification

### Three Distinct Role Types:

1. **Platform Admin (`admin` role)**
   - System-wide access
   - Can view and manage ALL tenants
   - Can change any tenant's plan
   - Can suspend/delete any tenant
   - **Only these users can access `/admin` panel**

2. **Tenant Owner (`owner` role)**
   - Manages their OWN tenant
   - Can invite users to their tenant
   - Can manage billing for their tenant
   - Can create teams (if Premium Plus)
   - **Cannot access platform admin panel**
   - **Cannot see or manage other tenants**

3. **Tenant Member (`member` role)**
   - Basic access to their tenant
   - Can create tasks
   - Can view team tasks
   - **Cannot manage billing**
   - **Cannot access admin panel**

## Testing Verification

### Test 1: Demo User (Owner) - Should NOT Access Admin
```bash
1. Sign in as: demo@example.com / password123
2. Check navigation: Should NOT see "üõ°Ô∏è Admin" link
3. Try accessing: http://localhost:3000/admin
4. Result: Should redirect to /app/tasks with access denied
```

### Test 2: Admin User - Should Access Admin
```bash
1. Sign in as: admin@example.com / admin123!
2. Check navigation: Should see "üõ°Ô∏è Admin" link
3. Click Admin link
4. Result: Should see Tenant Management page with all tenants
5. Can change plans, status, delete tenants
```

### Test 3: Demo User Cannot Delete Admin's Tenant
```bash
1. Sign in as demo user
2. Cannot access /admin at all
3. Cannot see admin tenant
4. Cannot perform any platform-wide operations
```

## Database Structure Explanation

The "Demo Workspace" showing **2 members** is CORRECT:
- Member 1: demo@example.com (role: owner)
- Member 2: admin@example.com (role: admin)

Both users are members of the demo tenant, which is normal for testing purposes. The admin user needs to be a member of at least one tenant to test features, but their "admin" role gives them platform-wide access.

## Security Best Practices Applied

‚úÖ **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only admin role can access platform functions
‚úÖ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Clear separation of platform vs tenant permissions
‚úÖ **Defense in Depth**: Checks in middleware, UI, and server actions
‚úÖ **Explicit Deny**: Default to deny unless explicitly admin role
‚úÖ **No Privilege Escalation**: Tenant owners cannot become platform admins

## Future Considerations

1. **Audit Logging**: Log all admin actions for compliance
2. **Multi-Factor Auth**: Require MFA for platform admin access
3. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict admin panel to specific IPs
4. **Session Timeout**: Shorter timeout for admin sessions
5. **Admin Invite Only**: Remove ability to self-assign admin role

## Files Modified

- `src/middleware.ts` - Admin route protection
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` - Admin UI access control
- `src/app/app/layout.tsx` - Admin link visibility
- `src/app/actions/admin.ts` - All admin server actions

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: After this fix, tenant owners will NO LONGER be able to access the admin panel. This is by design for security.

If a tenant owner needs platform admin access, they must:
1. Have a separate membership with "admin" role
2. Be explicitly granted platform admin privileges

## Migration Path (if needed)

If you have existing tenant owners who were using the admin panel:
```sql
-- Grant platform admin role to specific users
UPDATE "Membership" 
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE "userId" = 'specific_user_id' 
AND "tenantId" = 'their_tenant_id';
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Demo user cannot access /admin
- [x] Demo user does not see admin link
- [x] Admin user can access /admin
- [x] Admin user sees admin link
- [x] getAllTenants requires admin role
- [x] updateTenantPlan requires admin role
- [x] updateTenantStatus requires admin role
- [x] deleteTenant requires admin role
- [x] Middleware redirects non-admins
- [x] Build succeeds with no errors

**Status: ‚úÖ FIXED**

The admin panel is now properly secured and only accessible to platform administrators with the "admin" role.
