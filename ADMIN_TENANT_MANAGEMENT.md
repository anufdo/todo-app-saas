# Admin Tenant Management Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the admin panel to provide comprehensive tenant and user management capabilities for platform administrators.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Admin Layout (`/src/app/admin/layout.tsx`)
- Added **"All Users"** navigation tab to manage users across all tenants
- Added **"My Tenant"** quick link for admins to access their own tenant
- Shows admin's subdomain in the navigation bar
- Improved styling with purple theme for admin-specific elements
- Better visual separation between admin panel and tenant context

### 2. Created User Management Page (`/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`)
**New Features:**
- View all users across all tenants in a searchable table
- Search by user name, email, or tenant name
- See each user's:
  - Name and email
  - Tenant memberships and roles
  - Task count
  - Account creation date
- **Role Management**: Change user roles (member/owner/admin) for each tenant directly from the UI
- **User Deletion**: Delete users with confirmation dialog
- Responsive table design with hover effects

### 3. Extended Admin Actions (`/src/app/actions/admin.ts`)
**New Server Actions:**
- `getAllUsers()`: Fetch all users with their memberships and stats
- `updateUserRole()`: Change a user's role within a specific tenant
- `deleteUser()`: Delete a user account (with self-deletion protection)

All actions include:
- Platform admin authorization checks
- Proper error handling
- Path revalidation for instant UI updates

### 4. Updated Middleware (`/src/middleware.ts`)
- **Critical Fix**: Admin panel routes (`/admin`) no longer require tenant context
- Admins can access the admin panel directly without a subdomain
- Admin-only access enforcement remains in place
- Tenant context still required for `/app` routes

## Admin Capabilities

### Tenant Management
- View all tenants with stats (users, tasks, members)
- Change tenant plans (free, premium, premium_plus)
- Update tenant status (active, suspended, deleted)
- Delete tenants with confirmation
- See real-time usage counters

### User Management
- View all users across the entire platform
- Search and filter users
- See user's tenant memberships
- Change user roles per tenant
- Delete user accounts
- Track user activity (task counts)

### Navigation
- Easy switching between admin panel and tenant views
- Clear indication of current admin status and tenant context
- Quick access to admin's own tenant

## Access Control

**Who Can Access:**
- Only users with `role: "admin"` in the Membership table
- All admin actions verify platform admin status

**What Admins Can See:**
- All tenants in the system
- All users across all tenants
- Complete tenant and user statistics
- System-wide usage data

**What Admins Can Do:**
- Manage tenant plans and status
- Delete tenants
- Change user roles within any tenant
- Delete user accounts
- Access their own tenant as a regular user

## Security Features
- Server-side authorization checks on all admin actions
- Protection against self-deletion
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Role validation on updates
- Middleware protection for admin routes

## UI Enhancements
- Purple theme for admin-specific UI elements
- Clear role badges (Admin, Owner, Member)
- Tenant subdomain display
- Responsive design
- Hover states and visual feedback
- Search functionality with real-time filtering

## Usage

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Navigate to `/admin` (requires admin role)
2. **Manage Tenants**: Default landing page shows all tenants
3. **Manage Users**: Click "All Users" tab to see all users
4. **Switch to Tenant**: Click "My Tenant" to access your own tenant features

## Notes
- Admins have their own tenant membership, allowing them to use the platform
- The admin panel is separate from tenant-scoped features
- All changes are logged and validated server-side
- Real-time updates via Next.js cache revalidation
