## What Was Fixed

### ‚úÖ Admin Role Recognition
- Admin users now have their role properly stored in session
- Admin link only shows for admin/owner users
- Admin panel is protected and only accessible to admin/owner

### ‚úÖ No More Repeated Onboarding
- Sign-in logic now checks if user has a tenant
- If tenant exists ‚Üí redirect to workspace
- If no tenant ‚Üí redirect to onboarding
- Onboarding only shows once when creating workspace

### ‚úÖ Admin Panel Created
- Full tenant management interface at /admin
- View all tenants with statistics
- Change plans (Free, Premium, Premium Plus)
- Change status (Active, Suspended, Deleted)
- Delete tenants (owner only)

## URLs to Test

- Home: http://localhost:3000
- Sign In: http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
- Sign Up: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
- Onboarding: http://localhost:3000/onboarding
- Tasks: http://localhost:3000/app/tasks?tenant=demo
- Settings: http://localhost:3000/app/settings?tenant=demo
- Admin Panel: http://localhost:3000/admin

## Test Credentials

### Admin User
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: admin123!
- Role: admin
- Access: Full admin panel access

### Regular User
- Email: demo@example.com
- Password: password123
- Role: owner (of demo tenant)
- Access: No admin panel access (even though owner, only admin role gets access)

Note: To give demo user admin access, you would need to update their membership role in the database to 'admin'.
