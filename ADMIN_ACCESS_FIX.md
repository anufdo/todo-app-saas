# Admin Access Control - Quick Summary

## 🔒 Security Issue FIXED

### What Was Wrong?
- Demo user (tenant owner) could access platform admin panel
- Tenant owners could manage ALL tenants, not just their own
- Tenant owners could delete other tenants, including admin's tenant

### What's Fixed?
- **Only users with "admin" role** can access `/admin` panel
- Tenant owners ("owner" role) can only manage their own workspace
- Clear separation between platform admin and tenant management

**Demo Workspace shows 2 members - This is CORRECT:**
1. demo@example.com (owner)
2. admin@example.com (admin)
